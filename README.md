# RSA-alogrithm-in-C
RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm for secure data transmission. It is based on the mathematical problem of factoring large prime numbers. The RSA algorithm encrypts a plaintext message into a ciphertext using the public key of the recipient and decrypts it using the recipient's private key.
